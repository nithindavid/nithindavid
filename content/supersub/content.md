Hey there,  
I’m a developer & designer from Bangalore, India, focused on design and development of great web and mobile apps. I also do User Interface Designs & illustrations for my side projects. I learned them out of passion and curiosity towards art and it really helps me craft apps with beautiful interfaces. 

I started my career back in 2014 with [FreshWorks](https://www.freshworks.com), Which was the best thing in my career, it surely  moulded me into a better developer. Currently I'm working with [Reflektive](https://www.reflektive.com), on react ecosystem. 

I mostly use React/Vue/ReactNative for making apps these days also big fan of GraphQl 🔥. Beyond JS, I have worked on Rails, Android and Node.JS. Occasionally I make open source contributions
